what:

  A game where your goal is to navigate a level and fight the enemy at the end.

how:

howto:

  Move the earth forwards and backwards with the "w" and "s" key, and spin counterclockwise
  and clockwise with "a" and "d". Interacting with the UI is done by clicking with them
  mouse; clicking and dragging on the screen won't do anything. A collision with
  the sun will trigger the change to the fight mode where the "w,s,a,d" controls
  are completely disabled.
